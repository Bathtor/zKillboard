Squizz stuff:
2 Code to notify admins of new items that need to be marked published, have descriptions added, and assigned groupID's as well
3 Code to update groupID's in zz_participants for new ship types after they've been modified per new code in #2
6 Fix up flags to flag name from database (currently hardcoded :/ )

Other:
- Edge case for entities with no entry in zz_participants

Karbo stuff:
- Finish up Account stuff (PM, Wallet, External Page Setup, External Feeds, Kill Detail Setup etc.)
- Move all post to the bottom of routes, and make sure the user is logged in, before allowing anything to be posted!
- Show character name under account/me instead of id
- Make small condensed embeddable posts of information for Detail and Related. So people can quickly copy/paste to news stories, forums and such
- Fix cmtChar dropdown to being globally available
- Start on idea to rework the account panel
- Look at integrating analytics live metrics, if that can't happen, find some javascript stuff that can do it
- http://www.flotcharts.org/ for account panel for the live metrics shit (maybe even everything)
- Account panel panel showing users kills posted manually (Maybe API posted kills too? dunno)
- Figured out if dude is a director/ceo by looking at the API, and show an account page with all his members, including their api key (if it's set or not)
- Show all comments posted by user
- Upvoting on comments, could happen with an entirely different comment system, which is live (updates with new comments automatically)
- Add /favourite/ to kills, plus show amount of favourites (a sort of like), plus show a list of them in account
- Add report feature, manual mails can still be faked, so we need that
- Move Autocomplete into Slim now that the /?/ issue is fixed (before it couldn't handle /?/ in the URL, now it can)

Either one:
- FAQ
- /tracker/ needs to show losses for the things that is tracked, marked as red
- Domain Tracker needs to work: http://megatest.zkillboard.com/ should show Karbowiak and Squizz
- https://zkillboard.com/detail/28999865/ killmail does not show content of containers

-- domain tacker working
-- related page fixed
-- admin/moderator/user pages finished
-- campaigns
-- stomp/queue thingy
-- edk compatible feed
-- manual mails
-- killmail reporting for manual mails
-- manual posts for ships with bays are allowed and API will replace them
-- json feed for related kills (for brdoc and such)

Possibilities:
-- custom url's (should fit under domain tracker)
-- advanced management of api keys (e.g. alliance leaders)

Suggestions:
- Added currency values wherever there is a total value
